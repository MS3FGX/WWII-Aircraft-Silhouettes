World War II Aircraft Silhouettes
=========
Inspired by the "[Spotter Cards](http://www.ameshistory.org/exhibits/events/aircraft_spotting_cards.htm)" issued to servicemen
in the 1940s, this project provides free and open source 2D (PNG, SVG) and 3D (STL) representations of the most common
military aircraft in use during World War II.

3D Scale
=========
Currently, the 3D STL files have been designed so the aircraft will print out at 1:700 scale, making them suitable for board
games such as *[Axis & Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_%26_Allies)*.

If there is demand, additional scales will be added to the repository.
